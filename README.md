# LLM-Summarization-and-Relationship-Phrase

Knowledge Graphs typically adhere to a subject-predicate-object composition. While applicable across various industries, this structure may often lack detailed insights, potentially leaving users with ambiguity. With a focus on enhancing comprehension, we are shifting our structure to Entity-Target-Relationship modeling, designed to offer deeper, more insightful knowledge graphs.

This endeavor remains a work-in-progress.

For this project, the primary aim was leveraging Language Model (LLM) prompts. The first step involved summarizing the text, followed by extracting relationship phrases using another LLM prompt. This led to the construction of knowledge graphs enriched with entities and edges that vividly illustrate events and issues tackled by our Knowledge Base Articles.
